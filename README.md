# Principal-Component-Analysis-PCA-from-Scratch
This repository contains an implementation of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) built from first principles, using only basic numerical and plotting libraries. No high-level machine learning, statistics libraries are used. The goal of this project is to develop a mathematical and practical understanding of PCA by implementing each step explicitly.
